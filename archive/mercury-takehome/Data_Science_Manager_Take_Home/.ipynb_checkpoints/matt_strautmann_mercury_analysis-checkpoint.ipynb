Investigate:<br>- Is featuring overwhelming users?<br>- Are we featuring products users can't access (Credit Card eligibility)?<br>- Test subtler intervention |\n| **Mixed results by segment** | Implement segment-specific logic: feature for high-growth only, or vary featured product by both industry AND growth potential |\n\n**Key Threshold:**\n- Minimum 15% relative lift to be worth engineering effort of personalization\n- No degradation in guardrail metrics (especially churn)\n- At least 2 of 3 industry types show positive direction (even if not all significant)",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "source": "### Question 1: Should we vary by industry_type or industry?\n\n**Recommendation: Use industry_type**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Sample Size**: We only have 278 approved orgs in the data (our eligible population). With 15 industries, we'd have ~18 orgs per industry on average - too small to detect meaningful effects. With 3 industry types, we get ~90 per group, which is workable.\n\n2. **Clear Signal**: The data shows industry_type has strong, consistent patterns:\n   - Technology: High Credit Card adoption (13%), moderate Invoicing (9%)\n   - Consulting/Marketing: Moderate Invoicing (7%)\n   - E-commerce: Low across all non-core products\n\n3. **Statistical Power**: Smaller groups mean we'd need much longer to achieve significance. With ~18 orgs per industry vs ~90 per industry_type, we'd need 5x longer runtime for same power.\n\n4. **Maintainability**: 3 variants are easier to maintain and less likely to have implementation bugs than 15.\n\n5. **Volume**: Looking at the weekly application volume (estimating ~10-15 approvals/week based on 278 in dataset), we need every org we can get.\n\n**What we'd lose**: Some specific industries have very different patterns (e.g., mercury_software at 78% vs mercury_retail_wholesale at 36% approval). But we can iterate to specific industries later if industry_type works.",

   "source": "## Key Insights for Experiences Team\n\n### 1. Industry-Specific Product Preferences Are Strong\n\n**Finding**: Different industry types have very different product adoption patterns:\n- Technology companies are 4x more likely to adopt Credit Card (13% vs 3%)\n- Technology and Consulting/Marketing adopt Invoicing at 7-9% vs E-commerce at only 1%\n- Debit Card adoption is consistent across industries (~49%)\n\n**Implication**: Industry-specific product recommendations could significantly improve adoption. The experiment proposal makes sense.\n\n### 2. High-Growth Segment Adopts Premium Products\n\n**Finding**: Organizations with high growth potential adopt Credit Card at 7x the rate of low-growth orgs (14% vs 2%).\n\n**Implication**: Growth potential should inform which products we feature. High-growth companies may need credit/capital products sooner.\n\n### 3. Critical Churn Problem Needs Investigation\n\n**Finding**: Product churn is alarmingly high:\n- Invoicing: 100% churn (all 16 users stopped using it)\n- Bank Account: 79% churn \n- Debit/Credit Card: ~27-30% churn\n\n**Implication**: Before focusing on adoption, we should understand why users are churning. Invoicing especially needs investigation - is it a product-market fit issue, UX problem, or something else?\n\n### 4. Approval Rates Vary Significantly by Industry\n\n**Finding**: Technology companies have 69% approval vs E-commerce at 45%. Within E-commerce, retail/wholesale is particularly low at 36%.\n\n**Implication**: Setting expectations early in onboarding could reduce drop-off. E-commerce applicants should know approval criteria upfront.\n\n### 5. Technology Companies Activate Faster\n\n**Finding**: Median time to activation is 11 days for Technology vs 28 days for E-commerce.\n\n**Implication**: E-commerce companies may need more onboarding support or different activation triggers. Consider industry-specific onboarding flows.",
