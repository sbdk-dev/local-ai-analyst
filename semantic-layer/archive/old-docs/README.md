# Archived Documentation - semantic-layer/

This directory contains outdated documentation that has been superseded by more recent reports and has been archived to reduce clutter.

## What's Here

### Phase Completion Reports (Outdated)
- `PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md` - MCP Server Implementation completion (Nov 7)
- `PHASE_4_1_COMPLETE.md` - Conversation Memory completion (Nov 8)
- `PHASE_4_2_COMPLETE.md` - Query Optimization completion (Nov 8)
- `PHASE_4_3_COMPLETE.md` - Workflow Orchestration completion (Nov 9)
- `PHASE_4_PLAN.md` - Phase 4 planning document

**Superseded by**: `.hive-mind/FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md` (Nov 11) - The authoritative final status

### State and Integration Documentation (Outdated)
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` - Snapshot of system state (outdated)
- `INTEGRATION_TEST_PLAN.md` - Original testing plan
- `INTEGRATION_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Earlier test results

**Replaced by**: Production test suites in `/tests/` and `/semantic-layer/test_*.py`

### Internal Documentation Process Files (Not User-Facing)
- `DOCUMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Documentation system design
- `DOCUMENTATION_BEFORE_AFTER.md` - Documentation migration details
- `DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for documentation reorganization
- `DOCUMENTATION_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of documentation optimization

**Note**: These are meta-documentation about the documentation system itself. Kept for historical reference.

## Why Archive?

**Reason**: To reduce cognitive load and make the active documentation set clearer. These documents:
1. Document intermediate phases that have been completed
2. Represent snapshots from earlier dates (now superseded by final reports)
3. Are planning/process documents (not needed after implementation)

## If You Need Historical Information

The archived documents are preserved for historical reference. Look at:
- `.hive-mind/agents/` - Contains detailed progress from each agent
- `.hive-mind/research/` - Contains technical research and analysis
- `.hive-mind/FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md` - The authoritative final status
